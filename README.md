Decentralized Organization Proposal
===================================

This is a proposal for creating a decentralized organization that will automatically redistribute money amongst some or all of its participants using existing technologies. By combining existing distributed hash table designs based on the XOR (bitwise exclusive-or) metric, with a decentralized payment network with public transactions, such as Bitcoin, the following protocol allows a group of participants to redistribute a percentage of all transactions happening either between participants, or between participants and non-participants, to a collectively agreed set of participants.
