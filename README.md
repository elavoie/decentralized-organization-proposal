Decentralized Organization Proposal
===================================

This is a proposal for creating a decentralized organization that will automatically redistribute money amongst some or all of its participants using existing technologies. By combining existing distributed hash table designs based on the XOR (bitwise exclusive-or) metric, with a decentralized payment network with public transactions, such as Bitcoin, the following protocol allows a group of participants to redistribute a percentage of all transactions happening either between participants, or between participants and non-participants, to a collectively agreed set of participants, in a fully peer-to-peer fashion. This protocol does not require fixed special priviledges for some of the participants and allows all the participants to collectively retain decision power over which participants should be included in the redistribution set. 

By choosing a set of independent but related organizations that offer a wide-array of complementary services to the wider population in its redistribution set, the protocol can compensate for the variability in the market potential of complementary activities that reinforce each others without one of the organizations having to act as a parent organization to route money around.

By choosing a set of representatives from the participants, whose role is to redistribute money amongst participants and non-participants, the protocol acts as a representative government redistribution mechanism, without the associated usual bureaucracy and the ability of participants to collectively quickly withdraw some representatives of the redistribution set if they fail to perform their role properly.

By choosing the entire set of participants in its redistribution set, the protocol acts as an efficient global redistribution mechanism without any human intermediary. 

In all cases, participation in the organization is entirely voluntary and should the organization under-perform compared to other alternatives, participants will stop transacting through it and it will effectively cease to exist. As such, the organization is therefore subject to a competitive pressure from other organizations operating in the same market and benefits from no special advantage. The combination of a low-overhead redistribution mechanism and a timely collective consensus mechanism has the potential to create nimble organizations that can integrate participants with a wide range of skills and common vision.
