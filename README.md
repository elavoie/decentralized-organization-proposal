Decentralized Organization Proposal
===================================

This is a proposal for creating a decentralized organization that will automatically redistribute money amongst some or all of its participants using existing technologies. By combining existing distributed hash table designs based on the XOR (bitwise exclusive-or) metric, with a decentralized payment network with public transactions, such as Bitcoin, the following protocol allows a group of participants to redistribute a percentage of all transactions happening either between participants, or between participants and non-participants, to a collectively agreed set of participants, in a fully peer-to-peer fashion. This protocol does not require fixed special priviledges for some of the participants and allows all the participants to collectively retain decision power over which participants should be included in the redistribution set.
